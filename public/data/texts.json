    "wild-geese": "You do not have to be good.\nYou do not have to walk on your knees\nfor a hundred miles through the desert repenting.\nYou only have to let the soft animal of your body\nlove what it loves.\nTell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.\nMeanwhile the world goes on.\nMeanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain\nare moving across the landscapes,\nover the prairies and the deep trees,\nthe mountains and the rivers.\nMeanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,\nare heading home again.\nWhoever you are, no matter how lonely,\nthe world offers itself to your imagination,\ncalls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -\nover and over announcing your place\nin the family of things.",
    "the-black-snake": "When the black snake\nflashed onto the morning road,\nand the truck could not swerve--\ndeath, that is how it happens.\n\nNow he lies looped and useless\nas an old bicycle tire.\nI stop the car\nand carry him into the bushes.\n\nHe is as cool and gleaming\nas a braided whip, he is as beautiful and quiet\nas a dead brother.\nI leave him under the leaves\n\nand drive on, thinking\nabout death: its suddenness,\nits terrible weight,\nits certain coming. Yet under\n\nreason burns a brighter fire, which the bones\nhave always preferred.\nIt is the story of endless good fortune.\nIt says to oblivion: not me!\n\nIt is the light at the center of every cell.\nIt is what sent the snake coiling and flowing forward\nhappily all spring through the green leaves before\nhe came to the road.",
    "sweet-darkness": "When your eyes are tired\nthe world is tired also.\n\nWhen your vision has gone\nno part of the world can find you.\n\nTime to go into the dark\nwhere the night has eyes\nto recognize its own.\n\nThere you can be sure\nyou are not beyond love.\n\nThe dark will be your womb\ntonight.\n\nThe night will give you a horizon\nfurther than you can see.\n\nYou must learn one thing.\nThe world was made to be free in.\n\nGive up all the other worlds\nexcept the one to which you belong.\n\nSometimes it takes darkness and the sweet\nconfinement of your aloneness\nto learn\n\nanything or anyone\nthat does not bring you alive\n\nis too small for you.",
    "when-i-was-a-boy": "I won't forget when Peter Pan came to my house, took my hand\nI said I was a boy; I'm glad he didn't check\nI learned to fly, I learned to fight\nI lived a whole life in one night\nWe saved each other's lives out on the pirate's deck\nAnd I remember that night\nWhen I'm leaving a late night with some friends\nAnd I hear somebody tell me it's not safe, someone should help me\nI need to find a nice man to walk me home\nWhen I was a boy, I scared the pants off of my mom\nClimbed what I could climb upon\nAnd I don't know how I survived\nI guess I knew the tricks that all boys knew\nAnd you can walk me home, but I was a boy, too\n\nI was a kid that you would like, just a small boy on her bike\nRiding topless, yeah, I never cared who saw\nMy neighbor come outside to say, \"Get your shirt\"\nI said \"No way, it's the last time I'm not breaking any law\"\nAnd now I'm in a clothing store, and the sign says less is more\nMore that's tight means more to see, more for them, not more for me\nThat can't help me climb a tree in ten seconds flat\n\nWhen I was a boy, see that picture? That was me\nGrass-stained shirt and dusty knees\nAnd I know things have gotta change\nThey got pills to sell, they've got implants to put in, they've got implants to remove\nBut I am not forgetting\nThat I was a boy too\n\nAnd like the woods where I would creep, it's a secret I can keep\nExcept when I'm tired, except when I'm being caught off guard\nI've had a lonesome awful day, the conversation finds its way\nTo catching fire-flies out in the backyard\nAnd I tell the man I'm with about the other life I lived\nAnd I say now you're top gun, I have lost and you have won\nAnd he says, \"Oh no, no, can't you see\nWhen I was a girl, my mom and I we always talked\nAnd I picked flowers everywhere that I walked\nAnd I could always cry, now even when I'm alone I seldom do\nAnd I have lost some kindness\nBut I was a girl too\nAnd you were just like me, and I was just like you"
